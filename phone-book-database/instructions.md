# Instructions 

Write a program that creates a database named `phonebook.db`. The database should have a table named `Entries`, with columns for a person’s name and phone number. Next, write a CRUD application that lets the user add rows to the `Entries` table, look up a person’s phone number, change a person’s phone number, and delete specified rows.

# Instructions 

Write a class named `Employee` that holds the following data about an employee in attributes: name, ID number, department, and job title. Once you have written the class, write a program that creates three Employee objects to hold the following data:


| Name | ID Number | Department | Job Title |
| ---- | --------- | ---------- | --------- |
| Luke Skywalker | 47899 | Training | Jedi Master |
| The Hulk | 39119 | Construction | Demolition Worker |
| Bullwinkle Moose | 81774 | Animation | Cartoon Character |

The program should store this data in the three objects, then display the data for each
employee on the screen.

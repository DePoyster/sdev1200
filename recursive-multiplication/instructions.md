# Instructions  

Design a recursive function that accepts two arguments into the parameters x and y. The function should return the value of x times y. Remember, multiplication can be performed as repeated addition as follows:

    7 X 4 = 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4

(To keep the function simple, assume x and y will always hold positive nonzero integers.)
